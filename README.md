# Global-Warming-Twitter-Text-Mining-SVM

---

### Target Question: 
Over the past 50 years, the average <b>global temperature</b> has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. And experts see the trend is accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred since 2000. 
Climate change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but several recent studies, including a 2015 paper published in the journal Science, have disproved this claim. And scientists say that unless we curb global-warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures could increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. 

### Goal:

To analyze and Train a Model over tweet dataset where we do Natural Language tasks over the dataset & describes the sentiment of public over the topic of global Warming and Climate Change over Tweeter Streamer.
